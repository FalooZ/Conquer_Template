# Conquer_Template

In this project, I am rewriting page template from this site: 

https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page196/conquer

The template is made using Bootstrap and JS. 
I have made this site without any extensions, it is pure html and css, 
because I am learning JS and don't know yet how to use JS and DOM properly.

This project was quite fun and interesting. I have used only flex box, 
because i want to learn how it works. 

Of course the most important thing from me is making this site full responsive.
I have used media queries for this.
